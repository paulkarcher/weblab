Please take this into consideration.<br><br>There is a small bug with Firefox, which is that the close tab icon shows up in the bottom left rather than the top right. I&rsquo;m triaging the issue right now, but it is so minor that I am choosing to submit regardless.<br><br>This has been tested by a friend of mine who is not so computer savvy, who found many bugs that I patched today. Most of the bugs that were found revolved around closing all of the tabs then generating new ones, which would put the new table in both a new tab and the existing one. This was fixed immediately and works properly now. (Just saying this because I appreciated the comment about having someone try to poke holes in it).",

Additionally, there are some minor issues that I ran out of time to debug for this assignment all of which were non critical. Firstly, when numbers are entered that are valid but cause a range error require re entry. The error for this is detected but the fields must be re entered. Secondly, I wanted to have the form for this assignment contained within a modal. However, I ran into several major bootstrap and jQueryUI conflicts which ultimately made the modal useless.<br>Finally, as opposed to using the standard jQuery validation which we discussed in class I used bootstrapValidate. The libraries are identical except that the HTML classes and methods are bootstrap friendly.<br>",
